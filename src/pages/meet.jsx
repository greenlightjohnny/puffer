            <h3>Our Plan</h3>
            <p>
              How do we get away with not charging a large upfront fee for
              building websites? Well, we view it as in investment. We want to
              keep you with us as a happy customer for as long as possible. We
              really don't profit much from a new customer the first year they
              are with us. However, we believe in our work so much that we think
              most business owners will stick with us.

            <h3>Why We Started</h3>
            <p>
              After being employees of large agencies creating websites, we
              noticed a trend of a large up front costs to the customer, and
              sub-par customer service after the site was up and running. We
              realized that a large portion of the up front costs was going
              directly to the company overhead. Rent, human resources, project
              managers, and of course the CEO. The employees actually building
              the websites were people like me and my partners, programmers,
              UI/UX designers, and artists. We think that we will be able to
              provide better service at a lower cost to our customers and at the
              same time more revenue for our us by cutting out the overhead. No
              office (for now), no human resources, no CEO, and no project
              managers.

            We won't try and sell you on a service we honestly don't think will
            benefit you. Yes, our websites are faster, more secure, and have
            better SEO. But guess what? Sometimes you don't need all that. If
            you have a local small business with no competition, your website
            should have no trouble ranking the highest no matter how slow it is.
            You don't need a super fancy, awesome looking, fully optimized
            website if you are the only game in town and don't sell anything
            online.{" "}
